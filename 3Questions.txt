1. why was the app we built in with Express is so important?
- we are at least a little bit familiar with the process of receiving an incoming request.
- making decision based on the user's input.
- then sending back a response.
- understanding this basic cycle of request and response is powerful because that's really all any application does. Lifecycle of http request.

- The real question becomes what do we do in between the request and response?

2.What is the missing ingredient that will let us build more advanced apps?
- mongodb environment, database system.
- we want to remember or store user's data.
- user registration, sign in
- any time you post a comment, new tweet on Twitter, it's getting saved into a database.
- learning database in the context of creating an application. Fullstack javascript application.

3. What are we going to do for the remainder of this course?
 - we are going to build 2 apps.
 - app 1: small, unorganized, oversimplified. focusing on learning database. Get us comfortable with the big picture, the basic mechanics of building a full stack app.
    - learn how to stick together the 3 environments: web browser, server, database.

 - app 2: big, organized, real-world.
  - template engines
  - user registration
  - user authentication
  - security
  - error handling
  - staying organized
  - much more
  - real world complication
  - real world best practices.
